	Jonah — I enjoyed having you in Computer Science 1A, and I am glad you're back for more. This semester in Computer Science 1B, we have had the opportunity to cover topics such as functions, list comprehension, and sets, something we will continue going into the second semester. Over the last couple of months—between nightly homework and assignments—we have had 3 unit tests, a midterm-level final exam, and 2 projects, including one that is about bank simulation and another covering the extremely fascinating topic of casinos.

	Unfortunately, I have seen some dropoff in your performance from last class to this one. On your unit tests, you have gotten grades of 25, 30, and 44 percent, with an average score of 33.0%. Your lowest score was on our test about dictionaries, but that could be because you were taken aback by my teaching style and therefore did not try your hardest. On the final, you received a grade of 10%, which is quite the bad score for a midterm exam. You have not done much of the homework in my class, and failed to turn in your assignments.  Also, you have missed 10 days of class. You can definetely improve on showing up on time, cleanup, and loudness. 

	That being said, I would like to highlight one of your strengths in my class this year. I have been really impressed by your work ethic: a valuable skill which I hope you can continue to use later on in life.  

	In the end, you have been an absolute menace to my class. I hope to never see you again. Your overall grade this semester was an F. Please don't take one of my classes again. In fact, here is a resource to help plan for your future. I hope you take advantage of it: https://www.goarmy.com/
