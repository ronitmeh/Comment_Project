	Tyler —  This semester in Psychology, we have had the opportunity to cover topics such as behavior and memory, something we will continue going into the second semester. Over the last couple of months—between nightly homework and assignments—we have had 2 unit tests, a midterm-level final exam, and 2 projects, including one that is about examining the brain and another covering the extremely fascinating topic of interviews.

	 On your unit tests, you have gotten grades of 99 and 100 percent, with an average score of 99.5%. Your lowest score was on our test about memory. On the final, you recieved a grade of 92%, which is a great score for a midterm exam. You have consistently done the homework over the semester, and have turned in many or all of your assignments as well. You have participated a normal amount over the semester, and I would like for you do it more often. Also, you have missed 2 days of class. You can definetely improve on talking with neighbors. 

	That being said, I would like to highlight one of your strengths in my class this year. I have been really impressed by your completing homework on time: a valuable skill which I hope you can continue to use later on in life. Furthermore, I like to applaud how you emailed if there are any questions. 

	In the end, you have shown an excellent work ethic this year. I hope to see you in one of my future classes. Your overall grade this semester was an A. I really enjoyed having you in class this year!
