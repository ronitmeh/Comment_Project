    "#Some considerations\n",
    "#1. As with real teacher comments, the more personalized and descriptive you can be about each student, the better.\n",
    "#2. You want your program to be dynamic and generalizable to other students besides the two sample comments given below.\n",
    "#3. Your program needs to be READABLE, since it may be used by someone other than you. Therefore, it needs to be commented well AND you need to make use of functions for readability. For example, if you write code to make sure that articles are correct (“a” vs “an” for instance), you will put that calculation separately in a function called “articles”.\n",
    "#4. In your groups, each person should be in charge of different functions. Then, all of your functions need to work together to create the final product.\n",
    "#5. Comments are written to the student, so the comments should be written to the student and use their name and “you” pronouns\n",
    "#6. Think of this project like a piece of software you are writing for teachers.  Different teachers should be able to use the software and have it work for them and make their life easier.  After filling in their spreadsheet and exporting it to CSV, the program should be able to generate useful comments that are as good or better than if the teacher had written each one separately.\n",
    "#7.  Before you start coding, think carefully about what you want the output to look like and how a teacher with no coding experience might use it.  Then work backward to what the spreadsheet should look like to support this final product all before you begin writing any code."
